# Safestay: Hostels & Hotels -  Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Safestay Hostel Group Performance Analysis** project! This project simulates real-world data analytics using synthetic data generated to reflect Safestay’s operational model across 18 hostel locations in Europe. The goal is to uncover key insights using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Plotly**, **SQL**,and **Data Visualization**, and demonstrate the impact a data analyst can make in a business setting.


##  Project Overview

This analysis focuses on two critical KPIs:

* **Average Occupancy**
* **Average Bed Price Per Night**

Timeframe of data: **January 2022 – June 2025**
Total data points: \~29,000 rows
Number of locations: **18 hostels across 10 countries**

```


## 🔍 Key Insights

### General Trends (Jan 2022 - June 2025)

* Average occupancy across all locations: \~117 guests per night
* Average bed price: £33 per night
* Occupancy consistently around **90%**, indicating strong business performance

### Observed Issues

* **Flat pricing across all branches** regardless of local demand or customer behavior
* **York Micklegate** branch consistently underperforms in occupancy
* **Inverse relationship** between pricing and occupancy in some locations (notably York)

### 6-Month Focused Analysis (Jan - June 2025)

* **Berlin** shows highest average occupancy (121/night)
* Occupancy fluctuates between **98 and 151** guests/day
* Despite steady pricing, occupancy shows **room for optimization** through better localized pricing strategies


##  Technologies Used

* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Plotly (interactive graphs & pie charts)
* Folium (map visualizations)
* Jupyter Notebooks (Kaggle/Colab)
* SQLite (optional SQL support)
* Git & GitHub for version control


## How to Use

Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abi-Abid/Safestay_Performance_Analysis.git
   cd Safestay_Performance_Analysis
   ```


## Business Recommendations

* Implement **dynamic pricing** based on region, season, and demand
* Investigate **York Micklegate**'s low occupancy with local feedback
* Track more KPIs like **Reviews**, **RevPAR**, **ReRTI**, **MPI** for holistic decisions
* Focus on **guest satisfaction** over flat pricing for long-term loyalty
